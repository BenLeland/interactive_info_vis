            This design is under the context of running. The idea of it is that runners like to usually run loops around lakes as they are easy and have a set length. I wanted to depict this in clock form where the runners represent the time being the hands on a clock around the lake.
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Design decisions: </strong> I chose  to add running lanes around the lake to better show the difference between the runners. I also made the seconds be on the inside lane because they would ideally be running around the lake quicker than the outside lane. I also used color to show the difference in the runners. I wanted to use a similar pallet for all 3 so I chose a red to yellow fade.</li>
            <li><strong> Future work: </strong> One idea that was that the exact time is hard to tell so a critique was to add a way to add markers showing time. Another idea for the future is to have the sun be variable and move through the sky as time passes.</li>
            </ul>

            For this running clock design, I chose to represent the ground as time passes when runners go over it. Every large step is an hour, medium is minutes, and small is seconds. I thought that with hours being larger that a larger person would be stepping. The other steps follow the same concept.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Some choices that I made for this design were to have every step be a slightly light color. Smaller people leave less deep footprints so the color should be lighter in that case. I also allowed the placement of the footprints to overlap because footprints are likely to overlap in real life.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> One idea that I had to improve this design based on critique are to represent night time better. If it were later in the day then there would be less light and the colors would be closer to black or gray.</li>

            For this clock that is based on running, I chose to show this in a smart watch form. I tried to get incrementally larger values tracked for steps being miles, flights of steps, and actual steps. 
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Some design choices that I made were to have larger values for tracking steps be values for larger types of time like hours vs. minutes. I also wanted to differ the time with different colors. The colors that I picked were based off of rgb because I know some health tracking apps have similar designs to this.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> One thought that came up during critique was that it was fairly bland. In the future I would want to expand the watch face and maybe add more data like weather so that it has more use.</li>
